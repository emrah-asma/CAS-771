Combining Semi-Supervised and Active Learning  and Its application to CIFAR-10
Deep neural networks have proven to be a powerful machine learning algorithm that can achieve high accuracy in classification with adequate clean data.  
However, clean data is hard to obtain with the limitation of cost and time. 
On the contrary, real life data are conveniently available with open source databases or query search engines, 
but they usually contain noises that could potentially jeopardize the accuracy of the training model because deep neural networks can overfit and generalize the noisy training data, resulting in performance degradation. 
In this project, we aim to improve the accuracy of deep neural networks in image classification with noisy data. 
We combined active learning and semi-supervised learning. We conduct extensive experiments on image classification on CIFAR-10 and ANIMAL-10 to demonstrate the performance of our proposed approach with limited labeled data, 
compared to regular active and semi-supervised learning.
